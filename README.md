# eCommerce Course Final Project

In this repository my final project for the eCommerce crse in university is presented.
In this project, we practiced advanced methods for recommendation systems. The data used in the project is of movies from the movielens dataset.

We first analyze the data to find insights about it, and then we experiment the best recommendation model out of:
1. Baselines of recommending the highest ranked / random movies to all users/ men users / women users.
2. Recommendation from a trained model of factorization_recommender from turicreate.
3. Recommendation system based on Neural Collaborative Filtering Model
4. Recommendation system based on DeepFM model (using the DeepCTR package)
